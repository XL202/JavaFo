# Properties to setup a random tournament
#****************************************
# PlayersNumber => number of players
PlayersNumber=8

# RoundsNumber  => number of rounds
RoundsNumber=7

# DrawPercentage => percentage of draws
#    Nearly each game has such a probability to end in a draw
DrawPercentage=0

# ForfeitRate => average number of games before getting a forfeited game
#    A low number (e.g 5) means a high number of forfeited games
#    A high number (e.g. 1000) sort of eliminates forfeited games
ForfeitRate=0

# RetiredRate => average number of players (in the whole tournament) before getting an absent player
#    It is a rate, so it is valid what was said for forfeits
#    Can never be less than 2 - the autogenerator will check, though
RetiredRate=0

# HalfPointByeRate => average number of players (in the whole tournament) before getting a player requesting a half point byes
#    It is a rate, so see above
HalfPointByeRate=0

# Ratings are randomically computed in the range lowest-highest
#    Two players will not have the same rating 
#    HighestRating => the rating of the strongest player in the field
#    LowestRating => the tentative rating of the weakest player in the field
HighestRating=1500
LowestRating=1500

# To use a different scoring system from the traditional (1) (.5) (0)
#PointsForWin=1.0
#PointsForDraw=0.5
